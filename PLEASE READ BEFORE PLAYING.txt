Before playing the game, make sure to have the modules pygame and random. Please download all the files because they are all important to the program (click clone or download button). Mac and Windows computers will produce different results for running code so make sure to check out my video to see how it runs on the device I coded on (Mac). I've noticed that it runs way more smoothly on Mac than it does Windows. Also, make sure to have an audio device connected or an error will pop up.
